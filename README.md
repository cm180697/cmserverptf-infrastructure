# AWS Cloud & DevOps Portfolio Project

This repository contains the infrastructure and application code for a comprehensive, production-grade portfolio website hosted on AWS. The entire system is managed via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and deployed through a secure, multi-pipeline GitOps workflow.

This project demonstrates proficiency in two distinct, modern backend architectures running in parallel: **Serverless Functions (Lambda)** and **Serverless Containers (ECS Fargate)**.

## Technology Stack

### Cloud Provider
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform:** For defining and managing all cloud resources.
- **Terraform Modules:** For a clean, reusable, and scalable IaC architecture.
- **Remote State:** Using S3 for state storage and DynamoDB for state locking.

### CI/CD & Automation
- **GitHub Actions:** For building, testing, and deploying both infrastructure and application code.
- **GitOps Workflow:** A PR-based workflow with protected branches ensures all changes are reviewed and automatically deployed upon merge to `main`.
- **OIDC Connection:** Secure, keyless authentication between GitHub Actions and AWS.
- **Conventional Commits & Semantic Versioning:** For a clean, professional Git history and release management.

### Containerization üê≥
- **Docker:** For packaging the backend application into a portable, lightweight container.
- **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):** A private, secure registry for storing the Docker image.
- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate:** Runs the container in a serverless compute environment, demonstrating modern container orchestration without managing servers.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Provides a stable public endpoint for the containerized service.

### Backend Application
- **Dual Architecture:**
    - **Serverless Function:** An **AWS Lambda** function provides an API endpoint via **API Gateway**.
    - **Containerized Service:** A **FastAPI** web server running in **ECS Fargate** provides an alternative API endpoint.
- **Amazon DynamoDB:** A shared, high-performance NoSQL database for storing the visitor count, used by both backends.
- **Python:** The language for the application logic, managed with **Poetry**.

### Frontend
- **Amazon S3:** Stores the static website content (`index.html`).
- **Amazon CloudFront:** Acts as a global CDN for fast content delivery and provides a secure entry point with HTTPS.
- **Amazon Route 53:** Manages the custom domain DNS.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):** Provides the free SSL/TLS certificate.

### Code Quality & Testing
- **pre-commit:** For running automated quality checks before commits.
- **black & flake8:** For code formatting and linting.
- **pytest & moto:** For unit testing the Python application code in isolation.
- **Makefile:** Provides a simple, common interface for all development tasks (`make check`, `make test`, etc.).

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Amazon CloudWatch:**
    - A custom **Dashboard** for monitoring API, Lambda, and ECS metrics.
    - **Alarms** for budget alerts and critical security events (e.g., Root user activity).
- **AWS CloudTrail:** For a complete audit trail of all account activity.
- **AWS Config:** For monitoring resource configurations and compliance.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Architecture Proficiency:** Demonstrates the ability to build and deploy applications using both serverless functions (Lambda) and serverless containers (ECS Fargate), a key skill in modern cloud engineering.
- **Least-Privilege IAM Policies:** All IAM roles are crafted with the minimum necessary permissions, a critical security best practice.
- **Scalable CI/CD:** The application pipeline is designed to be efficient, running tests only for the code that has changed.
- **Complete Automation:** From a `git push`, the entire process of testing, infrastructure deployment, and application deployment is 100% automated.
